# Dashboard
The **[APP] Dashboard** is the main page of the [APP] console. The Cryostat Dashboard is able to provide a high-level overview of the [APP] instance and the target JVMs that it is connected to, through the use of **Dashboard Cards**.

Dashboard Cards are displayed in the Dashboard in a grid layout. These **Dashboard Layouts** can be customized by adding, removing, or rearranging cards. The layout can also be saved and restored at a later time. 

Switch between layouts at any time for control over the information that is displayed in the Dashboard.

Currently, the following Dashboard Cards are available:

- **Target JVM Details**
- **Automated Analysis**
- **JFR Metrics Chart**
- **MBean Metrics Chart**

Each card displays a different set of information about the currently selected target JVM, such as the heap usage, thread statistics, JVM vendor, and more.

### What you'll learn
- How to create a simple Dashboard Layout
- How to add and remove a Dashboard Card to/from a Dashboard Layout
- How to move and resize Dashboard Cards
- How to rename, upload, download, and delete Dashboard Layouts

[Learn more about each Dashboard Card in the upstream [Cryostat documentation](https://cryostat.io/docs/user-guide/dashboard/).]{{admonition tip}}
