# Dashboard
The **[APP] Dashboard** is the main page of the [APP] console. The Cryostat Dashboard is able to provide a high-level overview of the [APP] instance and the target JVMs that it is connected to, through the use of **Dashboard Cards**.

Dashboard Cards are displayed in the Dashboard in a grid layout. These **Dashboard Layouts** can be customized by adding, removing, or rearranging cards. The layout can also be saved and restored at a later time. 

Switch between layouts at any time for control over the information that is displayed in the Dashboard.

Currently, the following Dashboard Cards are available:

- **Target JVM Details**
- **Automated Analysis**
- **JFR Metrics Chart (BETA)**
- **MBean Metrics Chart**

Each card displays a different set of information about the currently selected target JVM, such as the heap usage, thread statistics, JVM vendor, and more.

### What you'll learn
- How to create a simple Dashboard Layout
- How to add and remove a Dashboard Card to/from a Dashboard Layout
- How to move and resize Dashboard Cards
- How to rename, upload, download, and delete Dashboard Layouts

[Learn more about each Dashboard Card in the [Cryostat documentation](${build.dashboardGuideUrl}).]{{admonition tip}}

    This will open a modal. From the card catalog, select the **Target JVM Details** card. Full details and available preview will be shown on the drawer panel.

2. Click Finish.
3. Repeat steps 1-2 to add the **MBeans Metrics Chart** card to the Dashboard Layout.
4. This time, click Next to go to the next configuration step of the creation wizard.
[The default metric selected for the card is the \`Process CPU Load\` metric. You can change this by clicking the **Performance Metric** dropdown menu within the **MBeans Chart Card** configuration step and selecting a different metric. Try other metrics and settings!]{{admonition tip}}
