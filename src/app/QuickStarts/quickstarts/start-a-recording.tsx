    introduction: `
# Start a Recording
**Java Flight Recorder (JFR)** is a profiling tool that is built into the JVM. It allows you to record events that happen in the JVM and then analyze the recording to find performance issues.

In this quick start, you will use **${build.productName}** to connect to a target JVM and start a recording of the target JVM's activity. You will then stop and download the recording to your local machine. Finally, you will view an automated analysis report of the recording with **Cryostat**'s capabilities.

### What you'll learn

- How to start/stop a JFR recording on a target JVM
- How to download a recording from **${build.productName}** to your local machine
- How to view an automated analysis report of a recording with **Cryostat**'s capabilities

### What you'll need

- A running instance of **${build.productName}** which has discovered at least one target JVM
- JMX auth credentials for the target JVM (if required)

There are two tabs within the Recordings page: \n
[Active Recordings]{{highlight active-recordings-tab}} and [Archived Recordings]{{highlight archived-recordings-tab}}.\n
Active recordings are recordings that are currently running, and Archived recordings are recordings that have been stopped.

We will start a recording while on the Active tab.

1. Click [Create]{{highlight recordings-create-btn}} to go to the Custom Flight Recording Form.
2. Enter a name for the recording in the [Name]{{highlight crf-name}} field.
3. Select the [Duration]{{highlight crf-duration}} for the recording. You can select CONTINUOUS to record until the recording is stopped.
4. Select the Events to record using the [Event Template]{{highlight template-selector}} selector.
5. Click [Create]{{highlight crf-create-btn}} to start the recording.

After the creation of a recording, the recording will be displayed in the Active Recordings tab. You should be able to see the recording's name, start time, duration, state, and any attached labels.

<sub>Note: You may also attach metadata labels to the recordings under the [Metadata]{{highlight crf-metadata-opt}} options or configure your custom recording further under the [Advanced]{{highlight crf-advanced-opt}} options.</sub>`,
