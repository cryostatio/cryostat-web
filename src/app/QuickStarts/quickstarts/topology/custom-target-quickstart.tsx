    introduction: `
## Custom Targets
By default, target JVMs are automatically discovered over remote Java Management Extensions (JMX) by **Cryostat**, using various mechanisms (e.g. **Kubernetes API**, **JDP**).
However, in some cases (e.g. for **Kubernetes API**, JMX port is not <code>9091</code> and port name is not <code>jfr-jmx</code>), Cryostat might not see your applications. Fortunately, you can tell Cryostat about them by specifying **Custom Targets**.

### What you'll learn
- How to test and create a Custom Target definition

### What you'll need

- A Java application that Cryostat cannot automatically discover
- The connection URL and JMX credentials, if required, for that application
