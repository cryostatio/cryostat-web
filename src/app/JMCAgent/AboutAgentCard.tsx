        The JMC Agent allows users to dynamically inject custom JFR events into running JVMs. In order to make use of
        the JMC Agent, the agent jar must be present in the same container as the target, and the target must be started
        with the agent (-javaagent:/path/to/agent.jar). Once these pre-requisites are met, the user can upload Probe
        Templates to Cryostat and insert them to the target, as well as view or remove currently active probes.
