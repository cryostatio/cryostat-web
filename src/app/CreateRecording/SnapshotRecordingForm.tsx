        A Snapshot recording is one which contains all information about all
        events that have been captured in the current session by <i>other,&nbsp;
        non-snapshot</i> recordings. Snapshots do not themselves define which
        events are enabled, their thresholds, or any other options. A Snapshot
        is only ever in the STOPPED state from the moment it is created.
